Markdown2Pdf
============

A simple library to convert markdown to pdf, **using Java**


##Why
Sometimes, it might come in handy to create a pdf version of a markdown file. This library combines several other libraries to leverage the hassle of converting everything by yourself.

The codebase is kept fairly small, while still providing a fluent API. 

##Prerequisites
###Version 1.0.x
This library only relies on the fact that you have at least Java JDK 1.6 installed. We support Java 1.8, and as of version 1.1 (which is still being worked on) we will make great use of the new features Java 8 has to offer.

```xml
	<dependency>
		<groupId>eu.de-swaef.pdf</groupId>
		<artifactId>Markdown2Pdf</artifactId>
		<version>2.0.1</version>
	</dependency>
```

###Version 1.1.x and up
This version of the library will only support Java 1.8.

##Building 
    > git clone https://github.com/Qkyrie/Markdown2Pdf.git
    > mvn clean install

##API examples
Instead of just providing you with examples here, we created an entire Class dedicated on teaching you the basics of the API. The class can be found in the repository, but for the current version, basically, this is it:

```java
	/**
	 * Welcome to the tutorial for Markdown2Pdf.
	 * We tried to create a page to demonstrate how to use our API. But in the end, we found that
	 * it was a lot easier to see how to use it when effectively using our code in a working example.
	 * <p/>
	 * If you look at the examples listed below, you should get the hang of how you'll be able to use
	 * and integrate this library in one of your own projects
	 */
	public class Tutorial {
	
	    @Test
	    public void basicExample() throws Markdown2PdfLogicException, ConversionException {
	
	        /*
	            Let's create an instance of the markdown2PdfConverter to work with
	         */
	        Markdown2PdfConverter markdown2PdfConverter =
	                Markdown2PdfConverter.newConverter();
	
	        /*
	            We'll have to specify where our converter has to get his markdown data.
	            With Java 8 in mind, we chose for a more generic approach, where we only have to
	            implement a class defined by Markdown2PdfReader
	         */
	        markdown2PdfConverter.readFrom(() -> "***Test***");
	
	        /*
	            Same thing goes for our writer. When the reading, cleaning and converting is done,
	            we need to do something with the resulted bytes. What you do with it is entirely up to you.
	         */
	        markdown2PdfConverter.writeTo(out -> {
	            //do something with it here
	        });
	
	        /*
	            What has the API done at this point? The simple answer: nothing. It only set the states and placeholders
	            for what it will be doing. It's lazily executed, which means that you'll have to explicitly make it do the
	            work in order for it to read, clean and convert.
	
	            Actually making the API do the work can be done as follows:
	         */
	        markdown2PdfConverter.doIt();
	    }
	
	    /**
	     * Our API has been implemented in such a way, that you can use it as a oneliner.
	     * The above example can be rewritten, as shown in the this example
	     */

	    public void basicExampleAsOneLiner() throws Markdown2PdfLogicException, ConversionException {
	        Markdown2PdfConverter
	                .newConverter()

	                .writeTo(out -> {
